The "phase oscillator hilbert" function does the following:

1. FFT to find fundamental frequency -> period
    Measure period in multiples of the time step

2. Identify where the signal first crosses zero with positive slope.
    Call this "trigger". Discard data beforehand.

3. Find left max (within 1/2 period of trigger) and left min
    (between 1/2 period and full period after trigger).

4. Find right max and right min.

5. Normalize downward portion of real data, and compute imaginary as
    sqrt(1 - x**2)

6. Smooth imaginary near x = +-1

7. Normalize upward portion of real data, compute imaginary.

8. Smooth imaginary near x = +- 1

9. Multiply imaginary by -1

10. Cycle triggers, go to #4.
